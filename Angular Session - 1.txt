Angular Building Blocks
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Component
2) Metadata
3) Template
4) Data Binding
5) Module
6) Service
7) Dependency Injection
8) Directive
9) Pipes


-> Angular application is collection of components. In components we will write logic to send data to template and capture data from template. Components are TypeScript classes.

-> Metadata nothing data about the data. It provides information about components.

-> Template is a view where we will write our presentation logic. In Angular application template is a HTML file. Every Component contains its own Template.

-> Data Binding is the process of binding data between component property and view element in template file.

-> Module is a collection of components directives and pipes

-> Service means it contains re-usable business logic. Service classes we will inject in Components using Depdency Injection.

-> Dependency Injection is the process of injecting dependent object into target object. In Angular applications services will be injected into components using DI.

-> Directives are used to manipulate DOM elements.

-> Pipes are used to transform the data before displaying


Environment Setup For Angular Applications
------------------------------------------
1) Install Node JS
2) Install TypeScript
3) Install Angular CLI
4) Install Visual Studio Code IDE

-> Angular 2+ framework is available as a collection of packages, those packages are available in "Node". To use those packages "npm" (Node Package Manager) is must and should..

	URL : https://nodejs.org/en/

-> After installing node software, open cmd and type node -v. It should display node version number then installation is successfull.

-> Angular framework itself is developed based on TypeScript. In Angular applications we will write code using TypeScript only.

-> We can install Typescript using Node Package Manager (npm). Open command prompt and execute below command to install TS.

	$ npm install -g typescript

-> After TypeScript installation got completed we can verify version number using below command in cmd. If it displays version number then installtion is successfull.

	 $ tsc -v

-> Install Angular CLI software using below command in TypeScript.

	  $ npm install @angular/cli -g

-> Check angular installation using below command

	  $ ng v

-> Download and install VS code IDE

	URL : https://code.visualstudio.com/download


Note: We are done with angular setup... lets start building angular applications
