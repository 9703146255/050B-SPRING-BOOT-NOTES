Spring Boot Actuators
######################

-> Actuator is one of the powerful feature introduced in Spring Boot

-> Actuators are used to monitor and manage our application

-> Actuators are giving Production ready features for our boot application

+++++++++++++++++
Actuator Endpoints
+++++++++++++++++

/health : To get application health status

/info : To get application information

/beans : To get what beans loaded by our application

/mappings: To get what URL patterns available in our application

/configProps : To get configuration properties loaded by our application

/heapdump : To download heap data

/threaddump : To get threads information

/shutdown : To stop our application (This is special, it is binded to POST request)


=> To work with actuators we have to use 'spring-boot-starter-actuator' dependency

		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
		</dependency>

-> We can see actuator exposed endpoints using below URL

		URL : http://localhost:8080/actuator


Note: /health is a default endpoint which we can access directly


-> We can expose other actuator endpoints using below property


+++++++++++++++
application.yml
+++++++++++++
management:
  endpoints:
    web:
      exposure:
        include: '*'


Note: To expose endpoints using application.properties we will use below property

management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*



+++++++++++++++++++
Working with shutdown
++++++++++++++++++++

-> IT is used to stop our application
-> We need to enable this manually
-> It is binded to http post request

management:
  endpoints:
    web:
      exposure:
        include: '*'
  endpoint:
    shutdown:
      enabled: true
